# DataHub.local - Bootstrap

Bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster via Ansible for deploying **DataHub.local**. With this Ansible project you can easily bring up a Kubernetes cluster on machines running:

- [X] Debian
- [X] Ubuntu
- [X] Raspberry Pi OS
- [X] RHEL Family (CentOS, Redhat, Rocky Linux...)
- [X] SUSE Family (SLES, OpenSUSE Leap, Tumbleweed...)
- [X] ArchLinux

on processor architectures:

- [X] x64
- [X] arm64
- [X] armhf

## System requirements

The control node **must** have Ansible 8.0+ (ansible-core 2.15+)

All managed nodes in inventory must have:
- Passwordless SSH access
- Root access (or a user with equivalent permissions) 

It is also recommended that all managed nodes disable firewalls and swap. See [K3s Requirements](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/requirements) for more information.

## Usage

First copy the sample inventory to `inventory.yml`.

```bash
cp inventory-sample.yml inventory.yml
```

Second edit the inventory file to match your cluster setup. For example:
```bash
k3s_cluster:
  children:
    server:
      hosts:
        192.16.35.11:
    agent:
      hosts:
        192.16.35.12:
        192.16.35.13:
```

If needed, you can also edit `vars` section at the bottom to match your environment.

If multiple hosts are in the server group the playbook will automatically setup k3s in HA mode with embedded etcd.
An odd number of server nodes is required (3,5,7). Read the [official documentation](https://docs.k3s.io/datastore/ha-embedded) for more information.

Setting up a loadbalancer or VIP beforehand to use as the API endpoint is possible but not covered here.


Start provisioning of the cluster using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook/site.yml -i inventory.yml
```

## Upgrading

A playbook is provided to upgrade K3s on all nodes in the cluster. To use it, update `k3s_version` with the desired version in `inventory.yml` and run:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook/upgrade.yml -i inventory.yml
```

## Kubeconfig

After successful bringup, the kubeconfig of the cluster is copied to the control node  and merged with `~/.kube/config` under the `k3s-ansible` context.
Assuming you have [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl) installed, you can confirm access to your **Kubernetes** cluster with the following:

```bash
kubectl config use-context k3s-ansible
kubectl get nodes
```

If you wish for your kubeconfig to be copied elsewhere and not merged, you can set the `kubeconfig` variable in `inventory.yml` to the desired path.
